# re/Place

This repository contains the code used for our ICWSM paper:  
["Latent Structure in Collaboration: the Case of Reddit r/place"](https://jrappaz.com/static/homepage/icwsm18.pdf)  
*Jérémie Rappaz, Michele Catasta, Robert West, Karl Aberer [ICWSM'18]*
  
The script `convert.py` pre-process the orginal dataset and `main.py` is used to train the model.

Edit: I noticed that the dataset is not hosted anymore. Feel free to [contact me](https://jrappaz.com) for a copy of it !
